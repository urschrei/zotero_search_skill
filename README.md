# Zotero Claude Skill

This is a Claude Skill to leverage the use of [Pyzotero](https://github.com/urschrei/pyzotero) to search and analyse users' Zotero libraries.

It uses the Pyzotero CLI to access the library, run searches, and analyse results. It also integrates with Semantic Scholar to retrieve related literature.

# Usage
Refer to the [skill installation instructions](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/README.md#try-in-claude-code-claudeai-and-the-api) in the official repo. I'm sure this will change a lot, so don't rely on it.
